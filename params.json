EDITOR  is a graphical editor for designing 3-dimensional \r\ngraph consisting of coloured edges and triangles.\r\nThe main intention is to make the modelling process as direct\r\nas possible without additional hardware required\r\nfor stereoscopic vision.\r\nI believe it can be used for many useful purposes\r\n(e.g. designing 3D scenes in computer games).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph is represented by following objects:\r\n\r\n1. Array of VERTICES; each vertex is placed in a point of 3D space.\r\n\r\n2. Array of coloured EDGES; each edge is represented by line segment between\r\n   its incident vertices.\r\n\r\n3. Array of coloured TRIANGLES; a triangle is analogue of an edge but \r\n   connects three vertices.\r\n\r\nThe remaining objects of the editor are:\r\n\r\n1. CURSOR: indicates position in 3D space and current colour.\r\n   Its orientation in the scene is fixed. \r\n   The shape of the cursor is asymmetrical to help you find\r\n   your orientation  in the scene.\r\n\r\n2. OBSERVER: represents your  position and orientation in 3D space\r\n\r\n3. SCREEN: represents the view-port (zoom, resolution, etc.)\r\n\r\n4. CONTEXT: modifies the meaning of some pressed keys\r\n\r\n3. GROUPS: each vertex belongs to a single group \r\n   (denoted by an integer). \r\n   Some actions can be performed on the groups of vertices.\t\r\n\r\nYou can manipulate these objects by invoking editing actions.\r\nMost of the actions are invoked by pressing the key while the input focus is\r\non the graphical window.\r\nSometimes you have to input a value in the terminal in\r\nwhich the program is started.\r\nAlso some actions are invoked by selecting an item\r\nfrom text menu in the terminal.\r\nTherefore you should run the program in terminal as a foreground process.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLING:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe program requires X11 with GL/GLX libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n------\r\nIn the directory containing the compiled program type:\r\n\r\n./et-edit [filename.et]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should have downloaded some example data: \r\nthe files with extension '.et'.\r\n\r\n(Warning: Keyboard CapsLock must be off.) \r\n\r\nSome simple tutorial is in HTML file:  doc/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nUSER ACTIONS:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou start the compiled  program with the command:\r\n./et-edit\r\n\r\nAfter starting the program, it opens the window, and reacts on the key press events in this\r\nwindow.\r\nOccasionally, it needs some text input from the terminal, where it is running.\r\n\r\nType <H> command to print the key actions on the terminal in default mode.\r\nWhenever you switch the mode (F1, F2, ...) the key actions for the mode are\r\nprinted on the terminal.\r\n\r\nActions are described in HTML file:  doc/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIRED PACKAGES:\r\n------------------\r\nFor compilation on Linux Ubuntu:\r\n * mesa-common-dev\r\n * libgl1-mesa-dev\r\n * libX11-dev\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING IN THE REPO CLONED FROM GITHUB:\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo build the project automatically, you need autotools and automake packages.\r\nFirst time after you clone the repository, \r\nyou need to run the script: \r\n   ./autogen.sh\r\n\r\nThen you may run \r\n* ./configure\r\n* make\r\n* sudo make install # if you want to install this in your system. Otherwise run: ./src/etedit\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
